Although I will include some very popular models, I will mainly focus on Logistic Regression. In particular, I will write an **intuitive** derivation of logistic regression and what are the necessary assumptions that one should fulfill before choosing this model. I believe that many new data analyst/scientists often fall into the traps of blindly using different models without understanding them fully. This will lead to many problems like overfitting/underfitting, which can be costly especially if your model is used to determine some real world problems. That being said, most of us here may not be mathematically mature enough to understand the proofs, that is why the next best thing that one can do is to understand the intuition behind each algorithm, and that will help you a long way. \n",

We can train different machine learning algorithms on the training data, in the hopes of finding one best algorithm for a particular problem that predicts well. Bear in mind that even if our algorithm performs extremely well on the training data, it may be a result of overfitting, and may not replicate the same accuracy when the algorithm is applied to some unseen (test) data. \n",

However the preceding sentence seems to have a problem, IF, in the real world, we do not have the 'answers' for the test data, how then, would we be able to tell how well the training algorithm is performing on the test set.

This involves looking at your data set from many angles, describing it, and summarizing it without making any assumptions about its contents. This is a significant step to take before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling, to make sure the data are really what they are claimed to be and that there are no obvious problems.

        "5. The second count plot shows the actual distribution of male and female passengers that survived and did not survive. It shows that among all the females 233 survived and 314-233 = 81 did not survive. While among male passengers 109 survived and 577-109 = 468 did not survive. Also, male survival rate is only 18.9 percent while female survival rate is 74.2 percent. This indicates quite a correlation between gender and survival rate."

As can be seen below, there is 0% of people who survived with 6 Parch, but this is because there is only literally 1 person who travelled on board with 6 parents/children; and 1 person is too small a sample size to conclude anything useful. Here I am open to comments on how to deal with issues like this, when some of the categorical levels have too little people to be indicate any underlying pattern. And hence to get the full picture, it is often good to plot a simple count graph so as to not get misled by mere percentages - a mistake some beginners might make."

When we say data are missing completely at random, we mean that the missingness has nothing to do with the person being studied. For example, a questionnaire might be lost in the post, or a blood sample might be damaged in the lab. Of course, this is not **completely random**, but the underlying idea is the missing data is not related to the subject of the missing data. https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/4/6502/files/2018/06/mcartest-zlxtj7.pdf\n",

        "\n",
        "   For example, take political opinion polls. Many people refuse to answer. If you assume that the reasons people refuse to answer are entirely based on demographics, and if you have those demographics on each person, then the data is MAR. It is known that some of the reasons why people refuse to answer can be based on demographics (for instance, people at both low and high incomes are less likely to answer than those in the middle), but there's really no way to know if that is the full explanation.\n",

For example, if we have detect_outliers(train, 2, [\"Age\", \"SibSp\", \"Parch\", \"Fare\"]), it means that we are looking at the data set called train and the columns involved are age, sibsp, parch and fare. However, if there is this guy called John and his age is 100, he definitely will be flagged out as an outlier , but is it fair to just consider John as an outlier just because he is old? So the author of the kernel that I linked earlier defines an outlier iff the person has more than 2 outliers at any one time. For instance, we only consider John as an outlier if he has n>2 outliers on him at the same time. For we find that John has age 100 and sibsp = 30  and fare as 1000000, and we have find out that these values of John are all outliers in its own right, then John has > n =2 columns as outliers, so then only can we consider john as an outlier. \n",

        "\n",

In age, we find the lower quartile and upper quartile of age and the IQR, making sure we ignore NAN values by np.nanpercentile (usually people use np.percentile, take note and in that case it is troublesome because if we do not ignore nan values, the lower bound and upperbound for age will both be nan because there are too many nan values.)\n",

However, little did I realise that back in the early 1900s, names were appended to their title - and different titles represent different social classes in the society, therefore **possibly** impacting one's survival.

Now the computer only likes to work with numbers, and as a result we need to convert S, C, Q into numbers. Like labelling S = 0, C = 1, Q = 2. However, Label Encoding has a big caveat, whenever you use this encoding method, the Embarked category now has a inherent ordered relationship; Signifying that C = 1 has more weight than S = 0, and Q = 2 has more weight than C = 1 and S = 0. \n",

However do note that LabelEncoder does not know what does 'cheap', 'normal' and 'expensive' mean. So it just assigns labels in order of appearance.\n",

Suppose that we are trying to predict the medical condition of a patient in the emergency room on the basis of her symptoms. In this simplified example, there are three possible diagnoses: stroke, drug overdose, and epileptic seizure. We could consider encoding these values as a quantitative response variable, $Y$, as follows: \n",

In reality, there is no closed form solution expression for the coefficient values that maximize the likelihood function, so that an iterative process must be used instead; for example Newton's method. This process begins with a tentative solution, revises it slightly to see if it can be improved, and repeats this revision until no more improvement is made, at which point the process is said to have converged.(Wikipedia)\n",
